With over 16 years in brand development, volunteer recruitment, and narrative creation for various causes, I use my writing, communication, and data analysis skills to craft compelling stories and reports aligning with my client's missions. Additionally, as a Machine Learning Consultant, I offer strategic guidance to clients, harnessing machine learning for data-driven insights to optimize business operations and achieve key strategic goals. 

I am pursuing a graduate degree in Data Science and Analytics at Old Dominion University, developing skills for building statistical models, trend identification, and problem-solving. I am passionate about leveraging data for positive social change, aspiring to inform evidence-based policies and practices. I am eager for connections and opportunities in service-oriented data science initiatives for future growth
