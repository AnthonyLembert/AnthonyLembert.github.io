Known for my commitment, I am concurrently working as an active-duty US Navy Corpsman while pursuing a degree in History at Oregon State University. 

I am a seasoned US Navy Corpsman with over 14 years of dedicated active-duty service. I am currently serving as a Shock Trauma Platoon Section Lead, overseeing the achievement of organizational goals and demonstrating strong skills in strategy, implementation, and delegation.

My diverse background includes roles as a Supply Chain Analyst/Facilities & Equipment Manager, Operational Medical Technician in San Diego, and Recreational Therapy Program Analyst. 

Driven by curiosity and dedication, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. after retiring from the Navy.
